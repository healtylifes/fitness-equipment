For the serious lifter and fitness enthusiast, the french fitness fsr70 dual cable smith &amp; half rack system might well be a dream machine. Strong enough to support as much as 800 pounds and still fit nicely in a home gym. I had the rack several years ago and, like an idiot, i got rid of it for some reason.</p>
