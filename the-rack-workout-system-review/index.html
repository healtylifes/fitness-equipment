The squat rack is the centerpiece of just about every home and garage gym in the world. The cable portion of the tower alone makes it worthy of consideration.</p>
<h3 id="as-such-it-should-be-versatile-durable-useful-and-fit-the-space-it-will-be-used-in">As such, it should be versatile, durable, useful, and fit the space it will be used in.</h3><p>I was even to find the original cd exercise routines on youtube! Low rows are very smooth on the powertec, but they do need to be done from the floor rather than on a bench. You are getting the whole set with two different workout handles in less than $50. For the serious lifter and fitness enthusiast, the french fitness fsr70 dual cable smith &amp; half rack system might well be a dream machine. Strong enough to support as much as 800 pounds and still fit nicely in a home gym. I had the rack several years ago and, like an idiot, i got rid of it for some reason.</p>
