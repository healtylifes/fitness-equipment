<p>Is la fitness a good gym? Get the workout you need with goodlife fitness. It’s still a significant markdown from the regular initiation price of $99, though. La fitness has two types of memberships:</p>
<h3 id="la-fitness-membership-costs-38-per-month-with-no-initiation-fee-for-6-months-of-single-club-access">La fitness membership costs $38 per month with no initiation fee for 6 months of single club access.</h3><p>For this single club membership, you don’t have to pay any initiation fee that you may have to pay for a nation wide membership. The cost depends on how many sessions you book, the experience level of the trainer, and pricing usually decreases as you book more sessions in advance. A few years back i paid $700 for 3 years with access to multiple la fitness locations. With this membership, however, you can visit only your home club. When that dried up, i now pay $220/year with no fees. For $29.99 per month (plus a $99 initiation fee and a $39 annual fee) you get access to multiple clubs in a single state.</p>
