Lastly, regardless of where your gym is located. Ive never used the coll ave gym during the year, only busch and livi.</p>

<p>Best time to go to the gym not busy. College kids flock to the gym post class (or post hangover, if it’s the weekend) and leave when its time to do homework (or time to get ready for a night out, ahem, weekend again).
