<h3 id="phew-this-is-a-hard-workout">Phew, this is a hard workout.</h3><p>Comment below if you saw results with her videos! The amazing result of these chloe ting workouts is your body getting stronger. In today’s video, i try and review chloe ting’s two week ab workout. It’s basic enough, and a rainy sunday was my cue to begin day one. I started with a short ab circuit, which at first seemed simple enough (no weights, no body bands, no resistance bands), but i soon found it to be pretty damn challenging. With all the time in the world, some are even choosing to start workout “challenges,” in which you participate in a workout schedule for a couple weeks.</p>
