When you are trying to figure out exactly how long you need to spend with a personal trainer, consider your budget, your fitness level, your availability, and how much weight you want to lose.</p>

Unless you�re getting very, very, very clear signals (like, she is asking you out for a drink or a date), you should 100% not flirt with a trainer. The trainer should direct you to another trainer and then pursue the personal relationship. Then a personal trainer may be the best option for you. Is it appropriate to date your trainer? The amount of time you spend with a personal trainer or the number of times you need personal training will depend on your personal needs and only you can determine them.</p>
