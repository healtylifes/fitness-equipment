<p>Feeling like you might throw up after a workout is a completely common side effect for athletes. However, you have to remember that this stimulant is consumed daily, around the world. These include sodium bicarbonate, magnesium, creatine, and caffeine. Wait a minimum of three to four hours after eating a large meal before you exercise.</p>
<h3 id="i-just-think-viruss-that-are-attacking-your-insides-are-way-worse">I just think virus’s that are attacking your insides are way worse.</h3><p>There’s nothing worse than showing up to your workout feeling nauseous, lightheaded, dizzy, or like you’re about to throw up the slice of leftover pizza you ate as you left the house. I am also taking creatine. If you suddenly do a crazy intense workout that might be beyond your ability, there’s a decent chance you might feel nauseous. But to the point where your body violently reacts is idiotic. Binge after you exercise, this way your metabolism is up and it will burn up the stuff you can’t purge. Drinking a large quantity of milk before you exercise can make your stomach feel upset and tire you out quickly.</p>
