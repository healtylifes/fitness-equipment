<p>Their claim to fame is their reasonable pricing that includes access to fitness classes, a heated lap pool, whirlpools, saunas and, at some locations, child care.

<p>No water fountain and towel service. They won’t have outdoor pools with water slides, but most locations will have a pool for laps and aquatic classes, a hot tub, and a sauna.
