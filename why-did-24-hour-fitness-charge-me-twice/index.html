<p>I would also look into la fitness if you want larger facilities, more equipment, and similar or better amenities. I join 24 hour fitness about two yrs ago at $39 a month, i haven’t been to gym since it closed, on april 5th they took $44.09 out of my bank account, not only did they charge me twice since closing, they took more then thay should have, i emailed them about it and i got no response back from them, please add my name james henderson, i’m belong to the moreno valley 24. It has diverse clubs all over the county to meet the various fitness needs of all its members. No member may train another member for compensation.</p>
<h3 id="although-price-is-comparable-to-steve-nash-i-am-now-going-to-af-richmond-because-it-is-transit-friendly-by-aberdeen-station-amp-they-don039t-have-pushy-sales-people">Although price is comparable to steve nash, i am now going to af richmond because it is transit friendly (by aberdeen station), &amp; they don�t have pushy sales people.</h3><p>So if you want to cancel because they are being scumbags and charging you when you�re closed, you won�t even be able to use the time later. I just assumed when i wasn�t able to go to the gym they would stop taking my money. I�m getting conflicting reports after going to a couple in the valley. Presently in the united states, it has 18,000 employees and 400+ clubs. 24 hour fitness sells these ear buds for $20.00 on up and i later went to walmart and bought a set for $10.00 that go over my ear and stay on the top of my ear and have had no problem with the ones from walmart that cost half as much. How much do you pay for 24 hour fitness?</p>
