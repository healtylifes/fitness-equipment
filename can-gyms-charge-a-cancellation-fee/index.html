<p>Can my gym charge me fees for canceling if they agree to no cancellation fee if leave? Your gym may charge a fee for cancelling your agreement. But when these fees impose a penalty, rather than compensating the gym for the reasonably expected cost (damages) connected to the cancellation, they are deemed “excessive” and “unconscionable.” that’s when the michigan consumer protect laws come into play. I wanted to use a fitness health club for 3 months before i moved out of the city, so i asked the general manager to give me the best deal.</p>
<h3 id="however-many-orangetheory-fitness-centers-only-charge-10-for-late-cancellations">However, many orangetheory fitness centers only charge $10 for late cancellations.</h3><p>Otherwise you can�t cancel but the gym can cancel your contract for any reason and if damage or violations is the reason they cancel, you�ll owe the contract plus $50. If you�ve paid fees in advance, talk to your gym about your options. A cancellation fee is a sum of money charged to a customer who has enlisted your services but failed to complete their end of the agreement. As with any contract, you can always contact a contract lawyer who can review the agreement and provide advice regarding your rights and obligations. Your gym should offer you a suspension of fees or cancellation as they close. I signed up for a gym membership last fall with a popular gym chain.</p>
