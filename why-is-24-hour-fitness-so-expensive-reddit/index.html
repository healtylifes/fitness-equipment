<h3 id="it039s-the-same-people-that-pay-the-ridiculously-expensive-pricing-of-lululemon-gear">It�s the same people that pay the ridiculously expensive pricing of lululemon gear.</h3><p>On march 16, the company closed all of its gyms nationwide — approximately 430. So you get 15 months of membership and gear for the cost of 12 months. But i havent checked in a while. Depending on the location, membership fees typically range between $31.99 to $56.99 per month, which means this discount is a significant percentage off if you break things down annually. One of them is a equinox, it cost $250 per month and it’s more expensive just because it’s a manhattan location/branch. A california gym member is suing 24 hour fitness usa for continuing to charge monthly fees despite locking its doors in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
